# Introduction

**Learning objectives:**

- Introduce book chapters.
- Understand the way the book is organized by sections. 

## What is this book about? {-}

> "The book is meant as a guide to making visualizations that accurately reflect the data, tell a story, and look professional. It has grown out of my experience of working with students and postdocs in my laboratory on thousands of data visualizations.". 
*Claus Wilke.*

## Preface {-}

- Github repo of the book https://github.com/clauswilke/dataviz. 
- Figures will carry the weight of your arguments so they need to be clear, attractive, and convincing.

## Preface {-}

- Evolve your understanding of figure preparation. Try to routinely expose yourself to new approaches, and pay attention to the visual and design choices others make in their figures. 
- Chapters have a logical progression but most chapters can stand on their own, so no need to read the book cover to cover.

## Thoughts on graphing software and figure-preparation pipelines {-}

- Automation is your friend. 
- They should come out of the pipeline ready to be sent to the printer, no manual post-processing needed -> reproducibility. 
- The visualizations can be generated with a few lines of R code via ggplot2 and readily available extension packages.

## Introducion {-}

- Data visualization is part art and part science. The challenge is to get the art right without getting the science wrong and viceversa. 
- Principles of visual aesthetics. 
- The book attempts to cover the key principles, methods, and concepts required to visualize data for publications, reports, or presentations.

## How is the book divided? {-}

- **Part 1 “From data to visualization”** describes different types of plots and charts and its primary emphasis is the science of visualization. 
  - Group visualizations by the type of message they convey rather than by the type of data being visualized.
- **Part 2 “Principles of figure design”** discusses various design issues and its primary but not exclusive emphasis is the aesthetic aspect of data visualization. 
- **Part 3 “Miscellaneous topics”** discusses file formats commonly used to store images and plots,  provides thoughts about the choice of visualization software, and explains how to place individual figures into the context of a larger document.

## Figures {-}

- ugly—A figure that has aesthetic problems but otherwise is clear and informative.  
- bad—A figure that has problems related to perception; it may be unclear, confusing, overly complicated, or deceiving.  
- wrong—A figure that has problems related to mathematics; it is objectively incorrect.
